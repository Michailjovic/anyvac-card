/**
 * Server-side cleaning tracker blueprint.
 *
 * The card fires `roborock_card_event` (action: cleaning_started) with the
 * full context — including the helper entity IDs of the selected rooms — so
 * this blueprint is fully generic: one static blueprint works for every
 * configuration, no per-user YAML generation needed.
 *
 * Flow:
 *  1. (optional) start notification
 *  2. wait until the vacuum leaves the dock (guards against the race where
 *     the event arrives while the state still reads docked/charging)
 *  3. wait until it returns to docked/charging (1-min debounce so brief dock
 *     visits between software-repeat passes don't end the session) or errors
 *  4. write per-room last-clean timestamps (input_datetime)
 *  5. (optional) single-room time calibration (input_number)
 *  6. (optional) finish notification
 *  7. fire cleaning_finished event (source: blueprint) — open cards listen
 *     for it and clear their room selection on every device

  description: >-
    Companion automation for anyvac-card. Triggered by the
    cleaning_started event fired by the card; waits for the vacuum to finish,
    writes per-room last-clean timestamps, optionally calibrates single-room
    clean times and sends notifications. Runs server-side, so it works even
    when no dashboard is open. Managed by the card editor (Global tab).
